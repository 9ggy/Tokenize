Fake "on-server-join" token logging. Hold victims "tokens" for ransom. 

Invite the bot to your server, anyone who joins will be messages saying their token has been leaked, with half of their token for verification purposes. They will dm the owner of the server (you) asking to be whitelisted. Just ask for some sort of currency: robux, nitro, etc.

##### *You will also get the half token in your log channel*
